# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses R for predictive analysis on a heart disease dataset. The main objectives are to preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used is [Heart Disease Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/code/desalegngeb/heart-disease-predictions). It contains the following features:
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Gender of the patient (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (categorical)
- `trtbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dL)
- `output`: Target variable (1 = Disease, 0 = No Disease)

## Features of the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees)
3. Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix)
4. Visualizations (Cholesterol and Heart Disease Outcome)

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `scripts/`: All R scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `outputs/`: Results, saved plots, and model outputs.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
